## Design Principles

BeautyCRM Pro follows these core design principles:

- **User-Centric Design**: Focused on salon professional workflows
- **Accessibility**: Components are designed to be accessible by default
- **Responsiveness**: All components adapt to different screen sizes
- **Consistency**: Unified design language throughout the application
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js with App Router for server-rendered React
- **Components**: Functional React components with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for styling
- **State Management**: React Context and custom hooks
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Prisma adapter
- **Backend**: tRPC for type-safe API routes
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL

## Getting Started for Developers

To work with these components in your own code:

1. Import components from their respective paths
2. Provide necessary props and context providers
3. Refer to the documentation for each component for specific usage examples

Example:

```tsx
import { ClientProfileForm } from '@/components/ClientProfileForm';

function MyPage() {
  return (
    <ClientProfileForm 
      initialData={{ firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" }}
      onSubmit={(data) => console.log('Form submitted:', data)}
    />
  );
}
```

## Testing API Interactions

For components that interact with APIs, we provide mocking utilities in Storybook to simulate:

- Live API responses
- Slow network conditions
- Error states

Use the API response mode controls in relevant stories to test these states.
