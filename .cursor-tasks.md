Below is a very detailed, markdown-numbered list of one–story point tasks for an AI coding agent to work on. Each top-level item represents one small, testable story (with its corresponding Storybook stories) that cumulatively builds out the premium BeautyCRM Pro system for beauty salons. Each task is broken into detailed substeps with checkboxes that include the exact data and story states the component must support.

     - First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number, Address  
     - Beauty-specific fields: Hair Type, Skin Type, Allergies, Preferred Treatments, and Special Dates (birthdays, anniversaries).  
   - [x] Create a Storybook story called "ClientProfile – Empty State"  
     - [x] Render the form with all fields empty.  
     - [x] Ensure placeholder text is visible (e.g., "Enter first name", "Enter email").  
   - [x] Create a Storybook story called "ClientProfile – Populated State"

   - [ ] For each UI component that fetches data (client list, calendar appointments, inventory, financial transactions):  
     - Create Storybook "Mock API" decorators that simulate API responses directly in story states.  
   - [ ] Define sample JSON API responses:  
     - For clients:  
       {  
         "clients": [{ "id": "1", "firstName": "Emily", "lastName": "Smith", "email": "emily.smith@example.com", ... }]  
       }  
     - For appointments:  
       { "appointments": [{ "date": "2025-05-25T10:00:00Z", "provider": "Stylist A", "client": "Emily Smith", "service": "Haircut" }, ...] }

------------------------------------------------------------
12. Finalize Documentation and Testing in Storybook  
   - [ ] Write inline documentation for each component directly in Storybook's "Notes" panel.  
   - [ ] Create README.md files that detail how to run Storybook, how to simulate different states, and the sample data used in stories.  
   - [ ] Ensure all Storybook stories include accessibility checks and performance benchmarks (e.g., load time for the calendar component must be under 1.5 seconds in Storybook environment).  
   - [ ] Perform manual review of each Storybook story state to confirm that all required data points and UI interactions match the SRS specifications.

------------------------------------------------------------

Each of these numbered tasks is a one–story point item that an AI coding agent (or human developer) can incrementally complete while using Storybook as the primary tool for visual component development and state simulation. The detailed checkboxes ensure every key data field, UI state, and error/validation scenario is handled for our premium BeautyCRM Pro product.
